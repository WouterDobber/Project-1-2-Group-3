This program can be used to display the trajectory of the planets of the solar sytem for 1 year, starting on 1st April 2020. In addition, a probe's trajectory from Earth to Titan is shown,
starting at the coordinates: (-1.471886208478151E11, -2.861522074209465E10, 8170057.668900404), considering Earth, and  with a velocity of: (27962.61762782645, -62349.24395947284, -666.7403073700751)
also including the velocity of the Earth.

Consider that the movement of planets and probe stops after the 1 year is finished.


The program contains several classes that are used to calculate the trajectories of the planets (objects of CelestialBodies class), such as: NewtonsFunction, RateOfChange and SolarSystemSolver.
In addition to this, the State of all celestialBodies throught the program is stored and can be retrieved by calling the suing the class State.
Moving on to the probe, classes used to to find an optimal starting position and velocity for it are: GA Trajectory and Probe.


Program Execution:
All files in the folder should be compiled using javac fileName.java in the command prompt. 
Then run it by calling java Run 
All images should be kept in the same file as they are. 


Enjoy :)
